In this case the traditional woven steamer basket is interpreted in perforated sheet metal to create a simple, no-frills café, that despite the pared back palette has really strong character.” Of WeWork Weihai Lu, shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.wantoday.com/WIN/2017/18/WI.html">Workspace Interiors</a> category, jury member Lee Penson, of Penson says, “This is a cultural game-changer – outstanding. Linehouse has combined eastern and western cultures together through really clever design.” We’re excited for the winning projects to be announced in London in February!
