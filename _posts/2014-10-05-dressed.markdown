The concept for this small shop for international brand Dressed Salads was to create a glass enclosed showcase for the salad preparation. The glass enclosure wraps through the space to connect both entrances in to the shop. Along this wall a rich composition of white glossy subway tiles, green glazed tiles, brass words, wood shelves, logos, menu boards, and plants are hung off a brass structure that is suspended from a small extending canopy and folds down the walls and floors. On the floor a pattern is created by the brass strips that is further emphasised by varying the tile sizes and directions. The inside of the kitchen is finished with green glazed tiles. A free standing brass table wrapped in green mesh seats 10 people.
