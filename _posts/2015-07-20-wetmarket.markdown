Our concept starts with the creation of a public park as an extension of the project. This gives a place for the community to make the market a destination for all to enjoy in many ways. To maximise the best part of the site we propose to locate the park adjacent to the river.

We have extended the architectural concrete grid of the existing building to allow the park to extend inside the building, whilst blurring the edge of actual indoor and outdoor spaces. We want to give the whole market the feeling of being outdoors.
