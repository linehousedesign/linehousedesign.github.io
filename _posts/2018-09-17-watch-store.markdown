Located on the Bund in a historical hotel building, Linehouse developed a concept for a watch store based on a sequence of spaces exploring the past, the present, and the future. Linehouse proposed to insert three passages at the entrance which aligned with the three existing openings of the old brick and stone fa√ßade. These passages were made up of plane walls which shifted in material from dark to light, and in translucency from opaque to transparent. Between the plane walls angled mirrors were placed giving visitors an alternate experience as they exit the store.
