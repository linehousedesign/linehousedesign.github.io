Linehouse completed a concept for a restaurant and bar at the W Shanghai called Skinny B. Skinny B embodies the flamboyant, self-indulgent customer who works too hard and plays too hard. The design references the architecture and colours of Palm Springs. In the center of the space is a bar clad in terrazzo bricks. An arched dark green metal curtain wraps the perimeter to create den like spaces.
