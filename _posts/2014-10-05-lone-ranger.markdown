Lone Ranger was seeking a modern interpretation of their Wild West theme to serve up their range of Corn Dogs. Replacing the entire fa√ßade of the shop located at the waterfront of the Hangpu River, Linehouse created a playful composition of white timber weatherboarding, raw timber, and custom white tiles featuring an arrowhead motif. The exterior is composed of opening doors and windows, which when opened reveals the continuous tile pattern which wraps the counters and floors. The exterior counters seats 6 with a further 6 seats inside. The 4m high ceiling void is filled with a rope installation which hangs down into the space as lights.
