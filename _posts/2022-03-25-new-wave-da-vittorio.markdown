CURATING TRANSITIONAL MOMENTS

The New Wave by Da Vittorio restaurant in the UCCA Edge museum in Shanghai is a coming together of disparate elements; a family run Italian restaurant from the foothills of Bergamo in Shanghai and a fine dining experience within the realm of an art gallery.

The New Wave Art Movement, which lends itself to the restaurant's identity represented confrontation between Chinese and Western Culture, resulted in bold experimentation that brought Chinese art into the modern art world. The concept for the restaurant comes from the collision of these opposing elements and the process of change.

Linehouse seeks to curate transitional moments through a sequence of abstracted and experiential spaces. Referencing the colonnade, in classical architecture defined as a long sequence of columns, we bring arches as a prototype element into the space, as one moves through the feature bar to interior dining and outdoor terrace, This abstracted colonnade brings guest from the public museum space into the more private dining room, through a compressed long corridor to a released open area, the sequence of arched mirrors create the illusion of an infinite journey dominated by spatial progression.  

The design of the ceiling installation throughout the restaurant was also born out of the abstract negative shapes formed by the interplay of rhythmically sized round arches. Ceiling fins are made of a unique Japanese triaxle fabric in woven texture, curvy cut and the vaulted volume give softness to the space.

Throughout the restaurant we seek contradiction in materiality to create qualities of soft and hard, rough to smooth, order to unordered and solid to transparent. Materials are manipulated as a catalyst for creating disorder, dissipation, fragmentation and surprise.

坐落于上海UCCA Edge三层的The New Wave by Da Vittorio,是UCCA集团旗下的第一家美术馆餐厅，旨在发掘中意文化对“家”本味的理解，同时将高端餐饮体验与艺术空间进行有机融合。

New Wave的名字以UCCA开馆展“85新潮”作为灵感来源，作为中国20世纪最重要的艺术运动，是一场对于新与旧，中国与西方艺术观念之间碰撞及重构的实验，也首次将中国艺术带入进国际视野。New Wave餐厅的设计概念也来自于对立元素的碰撞，过渡与重构。

Linehouse尝试像策展一样通过打造一序列空间来编策不同元素的陈列组合。基于古典西方建筑的柱廊空间构成，以及柱廊结构营造的空间秩序感，我们将圆拱的形态引入空间作为原型，随着主吧台-室内用餐区-室外用餐区几个主要区域的动线变化，这种抽象化的柱廊空间将食客由公共开放的美术馆空间引入至私密的用餐空间，空间经过狭长通道的挤压到用餐区释放，四面环绕且有序排列的拱形镜面制造出戏剧性的视觉幻象，感官体验在层层递进的空间中得到无限延展

遍布整个餐厅的天花挂布装置设计同样也是在由大小韵律变化的圆拱体块交错切合形成的抽象负形中诞生的。挂布由一种特殊编织肌理的日本塑胶面料制成，结合切割的流线型态以及整体形成的云雾一般的轻盈体量给空间带来柔软的层次。

整个餐厅我们寻求通过材料来表现元素的对立冲突：柔软与坚硬，粗粝与光滑，有序与无序，坚实与透明。材料作为感官的催化剂在空间中创造出惊喜。
