Linehouse designed a library and a public event and exhibition space for Vanke to serve the local community in a district in the south of Shanghai. Paper and layering were used as a starting point in the interpretation of a modern library. The ground floor was designed for congregation and to allow flexibility for different events. Screening to the above level offers a sense of the library beyond and a fine perforated metal reflects the lightness of paper. Occupiable walls were inserted to become working desks as well as shelving for the books. On the upper floor, the main reading room has a timber waffle structure lined on the outside with plastic tubing.
