AHOY is a retail concept located in Deep Cove, a community centered around a small bay and a marina. Linehouse designed a retail system that references the structure of a deconstructed ship. Ribbed elements form a skeleton, a perforated metal lining wraps the structure to create enclosure and the shelves are connected with industrial detailing.
