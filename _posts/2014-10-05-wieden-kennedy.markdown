The brief called for new office space for the video team of the Wieden + Kennedy Shanghai Office. The main part of the program was the creation of two new editing suites that could cater for video presentations and showcases. In addition open workspace, a kitchen, open meeting areas and breakout areas were created.

The concept was the insertion of two modern dwellings into the space that accommodated the editing suites but also functioned as the new entrance and a seating area. The dwellings were conceptualized as dwellings for the construction of ideas.
