Linehouse was commissioned to design the second store for streetwear retailer ALL SH, to create a completely different identity from the first store. The 20 sqm store is located in a design community with a large shop frontage.

Responding to the urban nature of the store location, Linehouse created a curved stainless steel installation which operates as a retail system on the interior, as well as a dynamic fa√ßade treatment. Perforated stainless steel panels with a graphical treatment of varying punctures and patterns were inserted, shifting between the inside and outside and creating pockets of retail display either facing out onto the street or into the store.

A large curved panel creates a sweeping passage for customers to enter the store. Tube lights are inserted within a U channel between each panel to create an impactful and playful lighting effect for passing pedestrians.
