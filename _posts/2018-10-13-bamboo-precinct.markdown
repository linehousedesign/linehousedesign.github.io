Linehouse developed the masterplan and architectural proposal for The Bamboo Precinct, a new mixed use development including residential, retail and F&B located in Kuala Lumpur. A language of suspended volumes unified under an undulating canopy was proposed. The canopy is opened up in areas to reveal exterior courtyards.
