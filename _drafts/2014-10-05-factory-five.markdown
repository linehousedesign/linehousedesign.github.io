The first shop for Shanghaiâ€™s premier fixed gear bike brand evolved organically over two years as opportunities to expand and redesign arose. The final 95sqm space featured a communal workshop, retail, an office and a built in table shared by the biking community for events, a resting place after long rides or a chat with friends.

The wood planks table for the table was sourced from a local demolition site and the existing white and brown paint was retained. A Georgian wire sliding glass door and metal framed window separated the office from the rest of the shop. For the retail area OSB board was used for the display units, the main focus being a horizontal lightbox.
