Linehouse designed a library and reading rooms for developer Vanke to serve as a community space for the local neighbourhood. Taking reference from paper book leaves, Linehouse sought to convey the notion of delicateness and screening through the project.    

The double height entrance space is clad in balmes stone which wraps up to become amphitheater seating for events and talks. A staircase to the second floor is carved through this stone landscape. A delicate perforated white metal screen hangs from the ceiling and wraps the upper level of the space; its structure in places revealed to become shelving for books. In places, niches within the screen become reading nooks or a place to sit and spectate on the activities below.

The reading rooms in contrast are a warm oak structure that lines the ceiling and walls to become shelving for books. Illuminated with a backlit stretched ceiling, the interior is a warm and bright space that is wrapped in glass tubes on the perimeter. Through light reflections and distortions on the glass tubes a sense of privacy and blurring is created for the readers.
