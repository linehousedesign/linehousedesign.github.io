LINEHOUSE was established in Shanghai 2013. The studio seeks projects of varying scales and typologies that allow us to explore both the poetic idea and pragmatic solution. Each project is an unexpected response to the client, physical context, brief and budget created through a process of dialogue, investigation, drawing, cutting, and collaboration. 

We have international experience in design and construction from the small scale and the intricate to the grand and public. We are drawing on our experience to create new ideas and outputs emphasising qualities of construction, materials and light.
